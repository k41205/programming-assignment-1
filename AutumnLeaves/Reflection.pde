 Part J: (3/3)
 
 My program saves the display in a PNG file on a right mouse click [3/3]

 Part K: (5/5)
 
 I have a really nice-looking final image based on the theme of an irregular grid, some cells are combined, and some are split.
 The cell contents use colors, randomness, text, and shapes overlayed on each other.
 It's also interactive, you can regulate the number of elements in the painting, resolution, and colors or you can get back to the default settings.
 You can save the image and generate a new one without closing the program.

 OVERALL MARK
 
 A+B+C+D +E +F +G +H +I +J+K
 5+2+5+10+20+20+10+10+10+3+5=100
 
 Structure of code = 100/100
 Complexity/Quality = Given by the lecturer
 Interview = 10/10 (default)
 
 Final mark = (100 by ? by 10)/10 = ?
 
 *** Constraints ***
 Ignoring the constraints results in the equivalent of scoring 3/10 = .3 for interview
